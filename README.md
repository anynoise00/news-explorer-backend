## About
The API for the NewsExplorer website, a website where users can search for news of any topic and bookmark the ones they like. 

In this project I made a REST API to interact with the News API, protected routes from unaunthenticated users, validated requests, and logged requests and errors.
This is the back-end of the project that was made as the final project from TripleTen's online web development bootcamp.
